# Snake_Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a growing snake that moves around the screen.
The goal is to eat food (represented as a block) to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself. 
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
